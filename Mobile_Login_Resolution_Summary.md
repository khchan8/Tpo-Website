# Session Summary: Mobile Login Resolution and Device Redirection

## 1. Initial Problem

-   The primary login page (`tpologin.html`) and its associated Google Apps Script (`NewCode.gs`) worked correctly on desktop browsers.
-   However, on mobile devices, attempting to log in via `tpologin.html` failed; specifically, the `doGet` function in `NewCode.gs` was not being executed, suggesting the request was blocked client-side.
-   Initial suspicion pointed towards CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues, potentially related to preflight (`OPTIONS`) requests on mobile.

## 2. Investigation and Initial Fix Attempt

-   Analyzed `NewCode.gs` and `tpologin.html`.
-   Confirmed `tpologin.html` uses JSONP (JSON with Padding) via dynamic `<script>` tags to call `NewCode.gs` for login (`handleLogin`) and validation (`validateSessionToken`). JSONP is often used to bypass standard CORS restrictions for GET requests.
-   Identified that the `doOptions` function in `NewCode.gs` (which handles CORS preflight requests) was minimal and might not be returning the necessary headers if a preflight *was* occurring for any reason.
-   **Action:** Modified `doOptions` in `NewCode.gs` to correctly return `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, and `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`.
-   **Outcome:** This did not resolve the mobile login issue for `tpologin.html`.

## 3. Alternative Approach & CRM Page Issue

-   **User Feedback:** An older mobile-specific login page (`tpologin-m.html`), presumably using an older version of the Apps Script, was found to work on mobile for simpler pages (`erp.html`, `performance.html`, `Fuzzies.html`) that only checked `localStorage` tokens before fetching data.
-   However, `CRMv4.html` and `CRMv4-M.html` still failed on mobile even after logging in via `tpologin-m.html`, redirecting back to the login page. This indicated an additional check within the CRM pages themselves.
-   **Analysis:**
    -   Reviewed `CRMv4.html`, `CRMv4-M.html`, and the CRM backend script `Code.gs`.
    -   Confirmed `Code.gs` performs necessary server-to-server validation by calling `NewCode.gs` (`action=checkAccess`) using `UrlFetchApp` before processing data requests. This check was *not* bypassed.
    -   Found that `CRMv4.html` and `CRMv4-M.html` contained an **additional client-side authentication check** (`checkAuthentication` function) that ran on page load. This function used JSONP to call `NewCode.gs` (`action=validateSessionToken`).
    -   **Conclusion:** This client-side JSONP call within the CRM pages was identified as the likely point of failure on mobile, causing the redirect before data fetching could occur.
-   **Action:**
    -   Created `CRM_Auth_Analysis_and_Plan.md` detailing the findings.
    -   Modified `CRMv4.html` and `CRMv4-M.html`:
        -   Removed the client-side `checkAuthentication` function and its call on `DOMContentLoaded`.
        -   Modified `initializeApp` to call `checkAuthorization` first.
        -   Modified `checkAuthorization` to retrieve the session token, user email, and granted tokens directly from `localStorage` instead of receiving them as parameters. It now performs the necessary permission checks based on this local data.
-   **Outcome:** This resolved the mobile redirect issue for `CRMv4.html` and `CRMv4-M.html`, allowing them to load correctly by relying on `localStorage` initially and the subsequent server-side validation during API calls.

## 4. Device-Based Login Redirection

-   **Requirement:** Use `tpologin-m.html` for mobile users and `tpologin.html` for desktop users, both for direct links and automatic redirects.
-   **Action:**
    -   Created `Login_Redirection_Plan.md`.
    -   Added a JavaScript function `isMobileDevice()` (using `navigator.userAgent`) to relevant pages.
    -   Modified `index.html`: Added a script to run on `DOMContentLoaded` that checks `isMobileDevice()` and updates the `href` of links pointing to `tpologin.html` to `tpologin-m.html` if mobile is detected.
    -   Modified `erp.html`, `CRMv4.html`, `CRMv4-M.html`, `performance.html`, `Fuzzies.html`: Changed the static definition of the `loginPage` variable to use a conditional check: `const loginPage = isMobileDevice() ? 'tpologin-m.html' : 'tpologin.html';`. This ensures the `redirectToLogin` function uses the correct page.

## 5. Final Adjustments

-   **Action:** Modified `Fuzzies.html`:
    -   Updated the `requiredToken` variable from `'tpoEmployeeToken'` to `'tpoFuzziesToken'`.
    -   Added a link to `CRMv4.html` in the header navigation bar.

## 6. Current Status

-   Mobile login issues related to client-side validation in CRM pages have been resolved.
-   Device-based redirection to appropriate login pages (`tpologin.html` or `tpologin-m.html`) has been implemented across the specified pages.
-   `Fuzzies.html` has been updated with the correct required token and navigation link.
